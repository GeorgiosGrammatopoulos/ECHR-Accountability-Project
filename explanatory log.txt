Version B2024030306, 09 April 2024


White Box simulation:
I am coming to realize that the legal and the factual assessment are two different processes under strict legal methodology. Now that I have the necessary metrics, I will start adjusting the weights of the simulation, to kinda fit the court's real-life metrics. I am definitely starting with an adjustment of the lower end of the legal and factual assessment weights, as cases which are blatantly unfounded are discarded in the admissibility session

Black box tests:
Black box testing demonstrates still an exponential decrease of voting outcomes, irrespective of changes. Under the present model, the legal outcomes do not appear consequential. Until further informatioon becomes available, the changes will be scaled back and other directions pursued.

Version B2024030306, 08 April 2024


White Box simulation:
Nothing of interest. Experimented with various sample sizes, except for one bug all is normal.

Black box tests:
Today I did not run any of the standard reports, as I was sent, thankfully, back to the drawing board.

After a conversation with my dear friend and experienced analyst, Alexandros Samaras, I resolved that I needed to revisit that assumption, with a view to the relation I originally observed.

After a few unproductive hours, I came to understand an implication of the relevant judicial psychology theory, which is also (and unintentionally) reflected in the model: the concept of the negative vote. That was why the voting patterns did not make any sense: because I was mistakenly associating the negative vote with the lack of a positive vote. I switched my working metric to the favor-against vote differentials, and I found that its pattern follows a discrete exponential distribution. Splitting the datasets also made me realize that this overall trend also reflects a strong preference for the respondent. 

Today was a good, big day.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306, 07 April 2024


White Box simulation:
Nothing of interest. Sampling works as planned. The topdown and bottom-up functions will be adjusted to serve as an adequate sample for the necessary black box amendments.

Black box tests:
In addition to the confusion matrices, I am now running a Poisson predictive model, to establish the vote tally. It still has a very limited predictive capacity, as do the rest of the tests.

The problem I am dealing with is the lack of information. Of course, I could always simply pipe more information from the simulation into the black box- however, this would lead to potential overfitting. Plus, the tests need to be useful even without inside or intricate information. The lack has to do with the voting patterns.

The only insight I have on the voting motivation of judges is their dissenting patterns: breaking anonymity and deciding to register one's opinion in public requires particular motivation, which is a bit different to the motivation of the original opinion. Before the ECtHR, the opinion process only includes nominal separate opinions. However, the judges usually declare their vote, along with their deviation or preference from the original caucus opinion. There are two chances:
-A concurring opinion is one in which the judge determines that they concur with the majority, but have motivations to express their opinion nonetheless
-A dissenting opinion is one in which the judge concurs with the minority, and still develops strong motivation to express their minds.

As a reminder, 16,7% of the ECtHR rulings include separate opinions.

Why judges express separate opinions is obvious: they concur with the majority, but have *substantial* differences from the majority. On the other hand, the reason why a judge would dissent has to do with a different factual or legal assessment- that is, motivation to reach a different conclusion. I will be introducing the new assessment tools in the basic simulatoin, and run tests on the correlation. What I should be getting, is the pure probability that someone diverges significantly, or disagrees on law and fact, given the probability of a national judge (around 14%). We see what we do with that information

Version B2024030306, 02 April 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal. I added a feature that prevents judges from examining a case when a violation is blatant (see ECHR jurisprudence). Also, I made slight changes to the code to generate a sample that includes dissent/separate opinion logic. I'll test it out tomorrow and see if it works.

Black box tests:
The integration of the blatant feature led to rather irregular results compared to the ones from last time: namely, a wider spread of compensation awards and some outlier instances, in which the court awarded a higher amount than the one asked. in the full dataset, the confusion matrices in legal and factual opinions were less accurate, but still achieved 82% accuracy; linear regression r-scores were also significantly reduced. However, on datasets that only accounted for favorable applicant outcomes, the accuracy was significantly higher. In datasets though which favored the respondent, the accuracy was significantly lower. the same difference was observed with datasets that had clear contests.

As a reminder: we are still training the model in a simulation, based on the procedure of the ECtHR. However, a probable source of structural fallacies becomes visible, even in that ideal environment: when the law seems "blatantly" in favor or against the applicant, not reviewing the facts is prejudicial to the procedure, regardless of whether the tally is in favor or against the applicant. if it is in favor, it is possible that the lack of discourse on the facts allows for more "emotional" assessment, at least as far as the non-material just satisfaction component is concerned. When the law seems blatantly "against" the applicant, the lack of factual discourse allows for more strict interpretations- potentially, against the evolutive interpretation of human rights. I believe there is a lot to follow up with here. However, for the moment I am sticking with replication and optimization.

in other news, tomorrow's simulation will have adjusted weights for omitting to examine the facts in blatant cases, and the tests will include a binomial logistic regression model on the dynamics of dissent against the total vote tally.

Finally, I will be taking a productive break from the model, to work on PhD proposals. I will run the basic ones and log whatever deviations may occur.

Version B2024030306, 01 April 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal. 

Black box tests:
The law and fact regression models present a relatively high accuracy, and the confusion matrices indicate a strong degree of predictability on vote outcomes.
The initial concept (that of a logistic regression model, predicting win/loss) was much less accurate. I attribute the lack of accuracy to the binary nature of outcomes, which does not allow for much detail in the outcomes, and leads to more generic predictions. In any case, confusion matrices demonstrate an 75-85% accuracy (depending on the population features) in the assessment that voting patterns in normal circumstances tend to hit large majorities. Howeverm, additional testing is required to validate those outcomes.

I will be constructing first an automatic report generator, then get on it.

Version B2024030306, 01 April 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal.

Black box tests:
Black box testing suspended, to redraft initial tests. Tomorrow I will be probably done.

Version B2024030306, 31 March 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal.

Black box tests:
Black box testing remains suspended, to redraft initial tests.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306, 30 March 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal. The minor bug, a zero-division error, persists, but it is not impeding the process, so its priority becomes rather low.

Black box tests:
It seems like the initial model is insufficient. The new logic commences with the impact of unequivocal law and facts. Black box testing suspended, to redraft initial tests


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306, 29 March 2024


White Box simulation:
Tests O1, O2, O3, O4 proceeding as normal. There was a minor bug in the calculation of the judge's demeanor, but I made a small adjustment to the code, and that fixed it.

Black box tests:
Initial tests do not demonstrate anything of interest, other than information already known. I am starting with writing some tests on the importance of policy considerations. The models are a bit more complex than I expected - I think I may need a refresher of memory.

Version B2024030306, 17-28 March 2024

The past days have been dedicated to appling to PhD programs and finalizing the white box simulation. Well,, it has been finalized- as much as the data will not be needing cleaning

Just by simulating, though, thw wokrings of the ECtHR, the following outcomes may be theorized:

1. The amount of applicants well exceeds the amount of applications, meaning that measuring implications, according to the procedure of the ECtHR, well exceeds the number of cases.
2. Perhaps relating to the random generation, the average amount awarded in material satisfaction significantly exceeds the average amount in non-material. The amounts I have been getting (average of 42976.57 of non-material against 49596.46 of material in the simulation) may be attributed to the opinion factor which reduces the amounts given. However, empirical observation indicates that the difference is proportionally much larger, which shows how some tests on that would be beneficial
3. The hypothesis that the distribution of voting outcomes may be attributed to social dynamics seems now invalid to begin with. Apparently, the prevalence of law and fact seem to be compelling factors which influcence the voting preferences of judges, hence leading to 'sterner' outcomes (a preference for the 7-0s rather than the 4-3s). However, the real data will indicate whetehr this hypothesis needs to be revived
4. Evem accounting for the bugs, the current model indicates a stronger preference for loss than win, emphasising on the impact of topdown assessments and the influence of the national judge. This simulation is stronger with handling controversial cases- in this example, controversy seems to be favoring the state. A test should control that.


the previous outcomes (henceforth, codified as O1, O2, O3, O4 respectively) have already been integrated in the report system and will be ran daily.
Additional orders of business:

1. Fix the bug messing up the vote tally of the judges
2. Repair and run the logistic and linear regression tests
3. Create a universal check for the impact of the priority factor introduced in the model
4. Create a test checking for the average difference between material and non-material satisfaction per bias factor
5. Prepare a report on the social dynamics behind the interactions of various agents, to design an agent-based model (to be run with sufficiency of data)
6. Prepare a check fof the preferencce of win/loss outcomes per case and judge. This control may indicate further implications for the way cases and individual prejudice impacts judicial outcomes

Version B2024030306 , 16 March 2024   


The log was right: I finished up with exports of judicial opinion into the relevant tables, and the formation of dataframes.

I am coming to observe a serious lack in information on how the judges decide. I have already incorporated in the code the randomness in the judges who eventually participate (especially accounting for ad hoc judges and the ballot for case-by-case membership). I am not, however, unaware of the inconsistencies. they will be factored in the final product- but, for now, progress on the basic processes is paramount.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306 , 11 to 15 March 2024


The latest focus has been arrangements of employment and seeking support for the proposal process. I guess actual work got deprioritized.

Between the 11th and the 14th, I restructured the database, in order to make it more versatile and integrateable with data input. I am making the GUI part my last priority. Also, I have started reading up on quantitative methods as well. On Friday 15th, I am to arrange data export in pandas dataframes, so that I am able to work with it. That will conclude the integration kanban item, so that I may move on to the simulations and case import. Then comes the restructuring of the tests.


Having completed the import and export functionalities, I am now moving on to supplementing  the judicial opinion simulation. This will require completing the subcaucus design, and creating a balancing function. I am not that concerned about the simulated cases; I have already completed an effective randomized simulation in the prototype version, which can help me generate sufficient data to build the prototype regression tests.

I ended up concluding the database integration. Tomorrow I am working on adjusting the judicial reasoning into the whole structure, and codifying it into a dataframe. Cleaning operations may become necessary as well.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306 , 8 to 10 March 2024


Yesterday was Saturday, today is Sunday- but I guess science can't wait.

Github is immense help. My girlfriend is asleep while I am working at her place, on her computer. Of course, this means sporadic entries, without any research value. I chose to focus on the strcuture of the database, and I realize how it is in fact much simpler than the previous version.

The idea is to focus on the different processes and counts over which the compensation is calculated, but I am fully aware that that is not representative. It is common practice before the ECHR to rule by exclusion: focus on the applicable articles, rule on them one by one, stop when a violation is found. I am not sure whether this practice is foundational of institutional bias. I guess I have an indicator updated: total false on the contest flags means that nothing came to question, hence that the matter was not examined.

On Friday, I also managed to put together a provisional schematic of the neural network that is ECtHR decision making. The potential fallacies are already indicative. I am already in a position to write a procedural amendment suggestion draft, which I refer to in the next version of my code. But first, I need to check the conventions for neural network schematics, and make one. I wonder if it is necessary, though. We will read up on the thing and see- not a priority at the moment.

In other news, only the prototype version is operational at the moment. I guess tests will remain on hold until I build the second one.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B2024030306, 6 March 2024:


There has taken place a long hiatus, to finish drafting the research proposal
It was valuable. I am now confident to say that my beta is not representative of the judicial process. I need to proceed with restructuring the whole thing, in the utility preference manner, startring from the simulatinoss.then, I will use the simulated datasets to redo my tests and hopefully get some results. Of course, minor refinement will be required, but at the moment i am too far away from the mark.

Building the simulation will require reference to utility preference modeling techniques, with which I am not familiar with. I think it optimal to make this an iterativer process.

No point with running more tests on a faulty device. However, we do have some optimistic outcomes:
1. I have verified that descriptive statistics are as important
2. I have arrived at the need to expand the database with more information.

Until I figure out the basic structure of the model, I will focus on an effective simulation. Priority assignments:

-Simulation: 8
-Regression refinement: 4
-Case load: 4
-Exploratory analysis: 2


In other neews, I am in a good state to build the intuitive decision simulator. Initial readings produce rather baffling results, though: since the coefficients are randomized (besides a national judge factor), some iteration sequences produce extreme outlier results compared to existing quantitative research. This is encouraging: the lack of consistency could indicate the existenceo of standard slopes or of more complex networks, which sway the decision-making process in a definitive manner.

I am finding that, by making the fact of the national judge a primary consideration, and prioritizing it compared to other considerations, results present less variance and converge around the percentages found by Voeten: 97%-80,5% intuitively in favor of the state. One must bear in mind, also, that the final ruling of the judge is a balancing between their top-down intuitive assessment and their detailed legal assessment- hence, it is expected that even the current, very discouraging assessment will be too conservative compared to the actual case docket. it feels like the system already promotes certain outcomes. For the moment, though, this simulation is sufficient, and will be refined in the months to come.

With that into account, the simulated judicial intuition appears rather balanced, except for the bias in favor of the state. Results appear in a wide range, and every iteration sequence is vastly different. But already, the results seem counter-intuitive: the assumption of total randomness is the favorable one. Still, that degree of "random" is simply impossible.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version B20240118, 18 January 2024:


Initial aggregations of the simulated dataset indicate similar patterns to those promised in legal theory: a normal distribution of voting patterns, with a significant, but not crucial preference for the state. The way the model is constructed, this preference may be attributed to the potential bias of the national judge towards their state of nationality.

Logistic regression outcomes are in line with those suggestions: they confirm the desired outcomes, by suggesting a slight advantage for the state due to the national judge, and no correlation with belonging on sensitive groups. Linear regression analysis on the amounts of compensation fails to demonstrate any statistically significant impact of the national judge on the amount of compensation, despite the effect of their presumed preference on the voting patterns.

However, these initial suggestions are way too simplistic to indicate the factors influencing the optimal reasoning of the judge.

Additional research indicates two other potentially crucial factors:
1. The fact that the case has been ruled as admissible leads to our sample only being populated with cases demonstrating an element of urgency, with their facts already established
2. The doctrine of the margin of appreciation suggests that the ECtHR will favor to an extent the interpretation of the law provided by the state

The new version will follow the same structure, only with an adjusted reasoning for the judges (to account for the margin of appreciation). Also, it will proceed with a presumption of the facts being relatively established in favor of the applicant- which affects the likelihood of the court accepting those facts, especially where there is no contest with the government record.
